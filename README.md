# MATLAB_BASED_Soil_Type_Detection
This is a project where I used MATLAB and Deep Learning for identifying the soil types using Images.
# Steps to Run this Project 
1. First create a Folder name Dataset
2. Now Inside this Dataset upload the folders given in the GitHub (Apple, Black Soil, Cinder Soil,Clay Soil, Gold, Jackfruit, Laterite Soil, Peat Soil, Yellow Soil)
3. Now keep this Dataset folder in the location where you are going to create the MATLAB Code.
4. Now create a matlab file (.m) where you store rgb_analysis.m, test_network.m and training.m files.
5. Now upload the other images given in the Git in the location where you save all the other folders and code.
